# Big_Data_Analysis_of_Jakarta_Meteorological_Trends_2000-2009
In this project, I analyzed Jakarta’s annual meteorological data from 2000 to 2009 to identify weather trend changes in Jakarta over the decade. This project was conducted using Python for data cleaning, processing, and visualization, focusing on key variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed.

The main components of the project include:

Data Collection and Cleaning: Data was gathered from trusted meteorological sources. Using Python (with libraries like Pandas), I handled data cleaning, addressing missing values, and formatting the data for accurate analysis.

Trend Analysis and Visualization: Annual trend visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, resulting in charts that display yearly averages for each weather variable. These visualizations helped uncover patterns in weather changes over time.

Reporting and Interpretation: The results of this analysis were used to develop a paper titled “Annual Trend Analysis of Jakarta’s Meteorological Data from 2000 to 2009.” The paper discusses significant changes in meteorological variables over the decade and provides insights that may support decision-making regarding climate adaptation strategies in Jakarta.

This project demonstrates my skills in big data analysis, data processing, and climate trend visualization, showcasing the ability to leverage historical data for long-term weather insights.
